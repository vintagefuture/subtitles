[00:00.000 --> 00:03.220]  I put a yellow and a black tape on it
[00:26.440 --> 00:27.760]  Ahhh!
[00:27.760 --> 00:29.760]  I'm sorry.
[00:31.760 --> 00:33.760]  There you go.
[00:33.760 --> 00:35.760]  The terrace?
[00:35.760 --> 00:37.760]  It's private.
[00:37.760 --> 00:39.760]  It's part of the apartment.
[00:39.760 --> 00:41.760]  It's registered as a disaster.
[00:41.760 --> 00:43.760]  Okay.
[00:47.760 --> 00:49.760]  What is it?
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.760]  Can you hear me?
[00:53.760 --> 00:55.760]  No, I can't hear anything.
[00:55.760 --> 00:57.760]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:57.760 --> 00:59.760]  And we're at the heart of the wedding.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.760]  In the middle of an animation district.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.760]  This kind of apartment
[01:05.760 --> 01:07.760]  is hard to find in Paris.
[01:09.760 --> 01:11.760]  The owners of this apartment
[01:11.760 --> 01:13.760]  don't put it on the market.
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.760]  The walls are very...
[01:15.760 --> 01:17.760]  dark.
[01:17.760 --> 01:19.760]  The owner is a bit like a chipot
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.760]  when the last locator left
[01:21.760 --> 01:23.760]  she asked him to repaint
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.760]  two months ago.
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.760]  He said he needed to repaint
[01:27.760 --> 01:29.760]  but not of any color.
[01:29.760 --> 01:31.760]  So, to avenge
[01:31.760 --> 01:33.760]  he repainted it in black.
[01:33.760 --> 01:35.760]  But it's a bit too much.
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.760]  Because it's in some places
[01:37.760 --> 01:39.760]  the blackness is perfect
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.760]  as...
[01:41.760 --> 01:43.760]  Attention.
[01:43.760 --> 01:45.760]  What is your son's name?
[01:45.760 --> 01:47.760]  Alphonse.
[01:47.760 --> 01:49.760]  Be careful because the floor is very slippery.
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.760]  What is the concept of the columns
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.760]  in the middle of the room?
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.760]  It's feng shui.
[01:55.760 --> 01:57.760]  Yes, feng shui.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.760]  The owner wanted to create a flow of energy
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.760]  between the living room
[02:01.760 --> 02:03.760]  and the bedroom.
[02:03.760 --> 02:05.760]  Alphonse.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.760]  Alphonse!
[02:07.760 --> 02:09.760]  Alphonse!
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.760]  Sir, you asked me to stay calm.
[02:11.760 --> 02:13.760]  Alphonse.
[02:13.760 --> 02:15.760]  I'm really angry.
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.760]  He's adopted.
[02:17.760 --> 02:19.760]  Why do you say that?
[02:19.760 --> 02:21.760]  Sir, you're an immobilized agent.
[02:21.760 --> 02:23.760]  We visit an apartment.
[02:23.760 --> 02:25.760]  It's not a family therapy.
[02:25.760 --> 02:27.760]  It's not serious at all.
[02:27.760 --> 02:29.760]  What is that?
[02:29.760 --> 02:31.760]  What is it?
[02:31.760 --> 02:33.760]  And when we know what it is,
[02:33.760 --> 02:35.760]  we'll call again.
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.760]  It's not a problem.
[02:37.760 --> 02:39.760]  Madam.
[02:39.760 --> 02:41.760]  Sorry.
[02:41.760 --> 02:43.760]  I have to answer you.
[02:43.760 --> 02:45.760]  It's my parents.
[02:45.760 --> 02:47.760]  Yes, dad.
[02:47.760 --> 02:49.760]  You're my client.
[02:49.760 --> 02:51.760]  I can...
[02:51.760 --> 02:53.760]  Huh?
[02:53.760 --> 02:55.760]  What?
[02:55.760 --> 03:19.760]  What's that?
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.760]  Okay.
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.760]  I have to read you the whole test.
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.760]  Can you read it?
[03:25.760 --> 03:27.760]  According to the law,
[03:27.760 --> 03:29.760]  I'm supposed to read the whole test.
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.760]  Can you read the whole test?
[03:31.760 --> 03:33.760]  It's not serious.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.760]  You listened to your mother's test.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.760]  It takes time.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.760]  Philip, I'm 50 years old.
[03:39.760 --> 03:41.760]  My mother is dead.
[03:41.760 --> 03:43.760]  I'm not hungry.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.760]  Take this round.
[03:45.760 --> 03:47.760]  The food is delicious.
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.760]  It's the Belgian chocolate.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.760]  As much as the wine is disgusting,
[03:51.760 --> 03:53.760]  it doesn't taste like chocolate.
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.760]  I don't know how they do it.
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.760]  Philip, are you going to please us?
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.760]  It won't be that complicated.
[03:59.760 --> 04:01.760]  My mother had nothing.
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.760]  Nothing?
[04:03.760 --> 04:05.760]  You don't have a car.
[04:05.760 --> 04:07.760]  No value items.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.760]  That's enough.
[04:09.760 --> 04:11.760]  My mother wasn't crazy about you.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.760]  So we read this nothing.
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.760]  We sign where you tell us.
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.760]  And we go to the next stage.
[04:17.760 --> 04:19.760]  In fact,
[04:19.760 --> 04:21.760]  it's not exactly like that.
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.760]  Yes, what?
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.760]  Your mother owned a furniture store in Paris.
[04:25.760 --> 04:27.760]  Which one?
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.760]  A furniture store in the 19th century.
[04:31.760 --> 04:33.760]  Can you tell me what you find funny?
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.760]  What I find funny is that
[04:35.760 --> 04:37.760]  imagine that your wife bought a furniture store
[04:37.760 --> 04:39.760]  and you weren't running.
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.760]  I'm not sure she bought it.
[04:41.760 --> 04:43.760]  She found it in the street?
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.760]  Why didn't you tell us before?
[04:45.760 --> 04:47.760]  It's a professional secret, Olivier.
[04:47.760 --> 04:49.760]  I'm your best friend.
[04:49.760 --> 04:51.760]  I know, but your mother didn't tell me anything.
[04:51.760 --> 04:53.760]  So she found it in the street?
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.760]  Wait, please.
[04:55.760 --> 04:57.760]  Dad, I need to understand
[04:57.760 --> 04:59.760]  what's going on.
[04:59.760 --> 05:01.760]  What's going on?
[05:01.760 --> 05:03.760]  Your mother owned this furniture store.
[05:03.760 --> 05:05.760]  She liked it.
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.760]  It's supposed to be good news.
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.760]  Good news, good news.
[05:09.760 --> 05:11.760]  And if not, your wife is crying.
[05:11.760 --> 05:13.760]  She owns her wedding box collection.
[05:13.760 --> 05:15.760]  Can you still use it?
[05:15.760 --> 05:17.760]  Do we exchange it?
[05:17.760 --> 05:19.760]  There are localities in this furniture store.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.760]  All apartments are empty.
[05:21.760 --> 05:23.760]  Except one.
[05:23.760 --> 05:25.760]  There's a locality.
[05:25.760 --> 05:27.760]  Her name is Liliane Petresco.
[05:27.760 --> 05:29.760]  She pays 550 euros per month.
[05:29.760 --> 05:31.760]  No, but it must be a knowledge of your mother.
[05:31.760 --> 05:33.760]  If I were you,
[05:33.760 --> 05:35.760]  I'd give her her share
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.760]  and I'd sell the whole furniture store.
[05:37.760 --> 05:39.760]  Olivier?
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.760]  Yes.
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.760]  Olivier,
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.760]  my condolences.
[05:45.760 --> 05:47.760]  Can you move your car, please?
[05:47.760 --> 05:49.760]  Yes, in five minutes.
[05:49.760 --> 05:51.760]  What's that?
[05:51.760 --> 05:53.760]  Nothing.
[05:53.760 --> 05:55.760]  It's for the clients. I just tasted it.
[05:55.760 --> 05:57.760]  Taste it?
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.760]  Enjoy it.
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.760]  I'm tired of doing this kind of thing.
[06:03.760 --> 06:05.760]  This thing,
[06:05.760 --> 06:07.760]  a lot of shit,
[06:07.760 --> 06:09.760]  it's going to be different before bed.
[06:09.760 --> 06:11.760]  It's a combination of authentic scarves.
[06:11.760 --> 06:13.760]  Yes, I don't care, Philippe.
[06:13.760 --> 06:15.760]  You remind me of my mother.
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.760]  You free us.
[06:17.760 --> 06:19.760]  We sign here.
[06:19.760 --> 06:21.760]  No, don't worry.
[06:21.760 --> 06:23.760]  If you want, we can go together.
[06:23.760 --> 06:25.760]  Yes.
[06:27.760 --> 06:29.760]  Come on.
[06:29.760 --> 06:31.760]  See you there at three o'clock, okay?
[06:31.760 --> 06:33.760]  Anyway, Julia's going to throw the trash.
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.760]  Say goodbye.
[06:35.760 --> 06:37.760]  Come on, Julia.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.760]  It's funny.
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.760]  You're going to throw the trash away?
[06:43.760 --> 06:45.760]  Why?
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.760]  It's a women's world.
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.760]  We don't have time to waste.
[06:49.760 --> 06:51.760]  You don't want us to stop?
[06:51.760 --> 06:53.760]  And then I'll make you some courses?
[06:53.760 --> 06:55.760]  I'll take away friends.
[06:55.760 --> 06:57.760]  But you don't want me to bring you home?
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.760]  I'm going to take a beer
[06:59.760 --> 07:01.760]  and then I'll find a place to sleep.
[07:01.760 --> 07:06.760]  Come on.
[07:06.760 --> 07:08.760]  Wait, I have something for you.
[07:08.760 --> 07:10.760]  What?
[07:10.760 --> 07:12.760]  A cognac bottle?
[07:12.760 --> 07:14.760]  A company animal?
[07:14.760 --> 07:16.760]  You remember what the doctor said, right?
[07:16.760 --> 07:18.760]  On balance.
[07:18.760 --> 07:20.760]  It's an idiot.
[07:20.760 --> 07:22.760]  No, listen.
[07:22.760 --> 07:24.760]  I'm going to let you fall.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.760]  You're going to break your neck.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.760]  Okay.
[07:28.760 --> 07:31.760]  I'm going to do what the idiot said.
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.760]  Bob, I data well.
[08:00.760 --> 08:02.760]  I'm going to dig.
[08:02.760 --> 08:04.760]  I'm going to dig.
[08:04.760 --> 08:06.760]  It's an idiot, isn't it Bob?
[08:06.760 --> 08:09.760]  You can't be each other's computer.
[08:09.760 --> 08:11.760]  It's cool.
[08:17.760 --> 08:19.760]  No problem.
[08:19.760 --> 08:21.760]  No problem?
[08:21.760 --> 08:23.760]  How is that educational?
[08:23.760 --> 08:25.760]  School double.
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.760]  This is the number 27 of the future of General Brunet.
[08:28.960 --> 08:30.760]  There's no number on the buildings.
[08:30.960 --> 08:31.960]  The 27?
[08:32.160 --> 08:33.160]  Yes.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.360]  Yes, that's me.
[08:34.560 --> 08:36.960]  Okay, thank you. Good continuation.
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.160]  Yes, look, I am General Brunet.
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.360]  Number 27.
[08:42.560 --> 08:44.160]  Yes, all the way down there.
[08:44.360 --> 08:45.960]  You have the first floor.
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.360]  If you go up a little bit here, you have terraces.
[08:48.560 --> 08:51.360]  And there you even have the lippards for the guy who lives in his penthouse.
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.560]  Did you find it on the plate?
[08:52.760 --> 08:53.760]  On the plate?
[08:53.960 --> 08:55.360]  One day, I was cleaning under the building.
[08:55.360 --> 08:57.360]  And it fell on my head.
[08:57.560 --> 08:59.760]  Okay, I immediately saw that you were a kind of distinguished guy.
[08:59.960 --> 09:00.960]  Yes.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.160]  Would you give me 20 euros?
[09:02.360 --> 09:03.360]  What?
[09:03.560 --> 09:04.560]  Would you give me 20 euros for me?
[09:04.760 --> 09:05.760]  My mother has a cancer from pancreas.
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.960]  If you give me 20 euros, I could pay her a hot drink.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.160]  I don't have the money.
[09:11.360 --> 09:12.360]  Are you kidding me?
[09:12.560 --> 09:13.960]  It's true, but it's time to start, sir.
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.160]  I'm not kidding.
[09:15.360 --> 09:16.160]  My mother is really sick.
[09:16.360 --> 09:18.360]  So if you give me 10 euros, I could pay her a bowl of soup.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.560]  And tell me, she's in a bad mood.
[09:19.760 --> 09:20.760]  It's the shit of your mother.
[09:20.960 --> 09:21.960]  Hey, it's 5 euros.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.160]  No, I don't have it.
[09:23.160 --> 09:25.160]  I don't give a shit, but at least you believe me.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.160]  Hey!
[09:29.360 --> 09:30.360]  Hey, stop it!
[09:30.560 --> 09:31.560]  Shut up!
[09:39.760 --> 09:40.760]  Oh, fuck!
[09:40.960 --> 09:41.960]  Shit!
[09:43.160 --> 09:44.160]  Shit!
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.160]  Are you all right?
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.360]  Well, I had a good time in New York.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.560]  Really?
[09:50.560 --> 09:51.560]  What's that?
[09:51.760 --> 09:52.760]  That?
[09:52.960 --> 09:53.960]  Yes.
[09:54.160 --> 09:55.160]  It's for the baby.
[09:55.360 --> 09:56.360]  Ah!
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  Next to the shoe store, there's an animal.
[09:57.760 --> 09:59.760]  When I went out, I saw this fish that was swimming.
[09:59.960 --> 10:00.960]  He was looking at me.
[10:01.160 --> 10:02.160]  We don't swim, fish.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.360]  You see what I mean?
[10:03.560 --> 10:05.560]  It's a very rare species.
[10:05.760 --> 10:06.760]  It's a very rare species.
[10:06.960 --> 10:07.960]  It's a very rare species.
[10:08.160 --> 10:09.160]  It's a very rare species.
[10:09.360 --> 10:10.360]  It's a very rare species.
[10:10.560 --> 10:11.560]  It's a very rare species.
[10:11.760 --> 10:12.760]  It's a very rare species.
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.760]  It's a very rare species.
[10:13.960 --> 10:14.960]  What?
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.160]  Do you know the story of the fish that makes them want to?
[10:19.360 --> 10:21.360]  The salesman of the store told me that in the original account,
[10:21.560 --> 10:23.560]  it was exactly this species.
[10:23.760 --> 10:25.760]  If you choose me, it's for happiness.
[10:25.960 --> 10:26.960]  But I'm your fish.
[10:27.160 --> 10:28.160]  Yes, yes.
[10:28.360 --> 10:29.360]  Tell me just a second.
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.560]  No, but...
[10:30.760 --> 10:31.760]  Be careful, he's fragile.
[10:31.960 --> 10:32.960]  Yes, yes, yes.
[10:33.160 --> 10:34.160]  Oh!
[10:34.360 --> 10:35.360]  Oh, fuck!
[10:35.560 --> 10:36.560]  You're stupid!
[10:38.560 --> 10:39.560]  Wait, are you all right?
[10:39.760 --> 10:40.760]  I'm just kidding.
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.960]  There's always no confidence with you.
[10:41.960 --> 10:42.960]  No, but...
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.160]  Don't worry, it's not your baby yet.
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.360]  It's just a stupid fish.
[10:45.360 --> 11:07.360]  It doesn't look like a stupid fish.
[11:15.360 --> 11:16.360]  Are you all right?
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.560]  Yes.
[11:17.760 --> 11:19.760]  You don't have to be so stressed out.
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.960]  I'm going to sell him the fact that
[11:22.160 --> 11:24.160]  it's not a place worthy of a woman of her age,
[11:24.360 --> 11:26.360]  but because she was a friend of your mother.
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.560]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11:27.760 --> 11:29.760]  You want to find a more suitable place.
[11:29.960 --> 11:30.960]  It's not suitable for you.
[11:31.160 --> 11:33.160]  You saw yourself, you're red like a tomato.
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.160]  You know,
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.360]  when I think I'm going to become a father,
[11:38.560 --> 11:40.560]  what scares me the most is that my child runs away.
[11:41.760 --> 11:43.760]  And I don't have the strength to follow him.
[11:43.760 --> 11:45.760]  Well, for the first year, they're going to be cramped.
[11:45.960 --> 11:47.960]  So you can only be cramped behind her.
[11:50.960 --> 11:51.960]  Listen,
[11:52.160 --> 11:53.160]  I forgot to tell you.
[11:53.360 --> 11:54.360]  I'll be back in the corner tomorrow.
[11:54.560 --> 11:56.560]  I have an appointment with your office.
[11:56.760 --> 11:57.760]  For what?
[11:57.960 --> 12:00.960]  I told you, I have to have some money.
[12:01.160 --> 12:03.160]  I don't have money, so I can't do that at home.
[12:03.360 --> 12:05.360]  But if I do, when he comes, what do I do?
[12:05.560 --> 12:07.560]  Well, you'll have the chance to meet him.
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.560]  He's an immobilized promoter,
[12:09.760 --> 12:10.760]  a superman type.
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.960]  I already talked about your imbecile, by the way.
[12:12.960 --> 12:13.960]  He's a potential buyer.
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.160]  You know I'd rather you ask me for my opinion,
[12:16.360 --> 12:19.360]  before I propose my own good to people you owe money to.
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.360]  How many floors are there?
[12:26.560 --> 12:27.560]  We are.
[12:27.760 --> 12:29.760]  Come on, do your job.
[12:29.960 --> 12:31.960]  I can do what I can.
[12:32.160 --> 12:34.160]  Who the hell is he, Franτois?
[12:35.360 --> 12:37.360]  He's old. He's probably dead.
[12:37.560 --> 12:39.560]  You say that for such a long time?
[12:40.560 --> 12:41.560]  Yes.
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.560]  Do you remember?
[12:43.760 --> 12:44.760]  You've got it.
[12:44.960 --> 12:46.960]  It's like you were in love.
[12:57.960 --> 12:59.960]  Nobody's at home.
[13:00.160 --> 13:01.160]  Shit.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.360]  Are we going to eat a piece?
[13:02.560 --> 13:05.560]  No way. If I'm late, Julia's going to make me a scene.
[13:05.760 --> 13:06.760]  She's jealous.
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.960]  Charlotte was like that too. She always thought I was wrong.
[13:09.960 --> 13:11.960]  No way.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.160]  Tronie immobilized, hello.
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.360]  No, it's nothing new.
[13:16.560 --> 13:19.560]  It's four bedrooms, the roof is locked.
[13:19.760 --> 13:21.760]  It's perfect.
[13:21.960 --> 13:22.960]  Very good.
[13:23.160 --> 13:25.160]  Olivier, there's an elevator.
[13:25.360 --> 13:27.360]  What can I tell you, Mr Jardin?
[13:27.560 --> 13:29.560]  Mr Jardin?
[13:29.760 --> 13:31.760]  I think he's an expert in Paris.
[13:31.760 --> 13:40.760]  No, I think he's an expert in Paris. This apartment is a mess.
[14:01.760 --> 14:04.760]  Ah!
[14:31.760 --> 14:33.760]  Ah!
[15:01.760 --> 15:04.760]  Ah!
[15:31.760 --> 15:33.760]  Are you okay? Everything's fine?
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.960]  Yes.
[15:38.760 --> 15:39.760]  Excuse me.
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.960]  When you arrived near the elevator, what did you see?
[15:46.160 --> 15:49.160]  That is to say that Philippe didn't move.
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.360]  The fish was moving without stopping.
[15:51.560 --> 15:53.560]  He looked at me.
[15:53.760 --> 15:55.760]  He looked at me.
[15:55.960 --> 15:57.960]  He looked at me.
[15:58.160 --> 16:00.160]  He looked at me.
[16:00.160 --> 16:02.160]  He looked at me.
[16:02.360 --> 16:04.360]  The fish looked at you.
[16:04.560 --> 16:06.560]  It's a very special fish.
[16:06.760 --> 16:08.760]  The Chinese say it exudes the...
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.960]  The Chinese...
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.160]  And when Philippe showed me the first time, I got mad at him.
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.360]  He was ugly.
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.560]  The fish?
[16:21.760 --> 16:24.760]  His daughter must have been happy the other day.
[16:24.960 --> 16:26.960]  He wanted to offer him something special.
[16:26.960 --> 16:29.960]  Who? Philippe?
[16:30.160 --> 16:32.160]  Is that the name of the fish?
[16:37.960 --> 16:39.960]  48 minutes.
[16:40.160 --> 16:42.160]  You think so?
[16:42.360 --> 16:44.360]  Yes, I said so.
[16:44.560 --> 16:47.560]  I said, ma'am, I lost my voice.
[16:50.360 --> 16:52.360]  Yes, I said ma'am or doctor.
[16:52.360 --> 16:57.360]  I may be a little doctor, but what does it change?
[16:59.560 --> 17:01.560]  What does it matter?
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.760]  You're not going to start again?
[17:08.760 --> 17:10.760]  Wait, wait.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.960]  Listen to me.
[17:13.160 --> 17:16.160]  I'm here to get rid of this fucking knife that you put in my skin.
[17:16.360 --> 17:19.360]  I'm not going to the hospitals to find fucking shots.
[17:19.360 --> 17:23.360]  No, no, I'm not going to kill you.
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.560]  It's not against you.
[17:25.760 --> 17:29.760]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[17:29.960 --> 17:32.960]  But, but yes, I may be smiling.
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.160]  I'm smiling because of politeness, but it's not like with your sister.
[17:38.360 --> 17:40.360]  With your sister, I was drunk.
[17:42.560 --> 17:44.560]  Hello?
[17:44.760 --> 17:46.760]  Hello?
[17:46.760 --> 17:49.760]  We're going to pick them up.
[17:52.760 --> 17:54.760]  Don't you see the fire?
[18:05.760 --> 18:07.760]  Thank you.
[18:07.960 --> 18:09.960]  What happened to you?
[18:09.960 --> 18:12.960]  I saved the life of a friend.
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.160]  A friend?
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.960]  It's a friend, yes.
[18:32.960 --> 18:36.960]  The car that was turned upside down, then it took fire.
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.960]  The windows were completely closed.
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.160]  They started to convulcate inside.
[18:45.360 --> 18:48.360]  So I...
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.560]  I knew what I was doing, I knew what I was doing, but...
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.760]  Until life broke apart.
[18:57.960 --> 19:00.960]  And life broke apart.
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.960]  And I thought my arm was broken.
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.160]  What did you do?
[19:09.360 --> 19:12.360]  I did what anyone would do to my place.
[19:12.560 --> 19:15.560]  Anyone? Like a hero?
[19:15.560 --> 19:29.560]  I wish I had a friend like you.
[19:45.560 --> 19:49.560]  Hello, you're welcome on Julia's local message.
[19:49.760 --> 19:52.760]  You can leave me a message after the beep.
[19:52.960 --> 19:54.960]  Good evening, Julia.
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.160]  What's up?
[19:57.360 --> 19:59.360]  What's up?
[19:59.560 --> 20:01.560]  What's up?
[20:01.760 --> 20:03.760]  What's up?
[20:03.960 --> 20:05.960]  What's up?
[20:06.160 --> 20:08.160]  What's up?
[20:08.360 --> 20:10.360]  What's up?
[20:10.560 --> 20:12.560]  What's up?
[20:12.560 --> 20:15.560]  What's up?
[20:15.760 --> 20:19.760]  What's up?
[20:19.960 --> 20:21.960]  What's up?
[20:22.160 --> 20:24.160]  I'm in a hurry.
[20:24.360 --> 20:28.360]  I don't want to talk to Julia anymore.
[20:28.560 --> 20:31.560]  I'm in a hurry.
[20:31.760 --> 20:34.760]  I'm in a hurry.
[20:34.960 --> 20:37.960]  I'm in a hurry.
[20:38.160 --> 20:40.160]  I'm in a hurry.
[20:40.160 --> 20:46.160]  I can't sleep this night. I hug you so hard. Goodbye.
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.160]  That's why.
[20:53.160 --> 20:55.160]  We're the Jordanians.
[20:55.160 --> 20:58.160]  Well, I'm a troddy.
[21:01.160 --> 21:03.160]  What's going on?
[21:03.160 --> 21:07.160]  We're not used to having visits with an immobilized agent in Chaucette.
[21:07.160 --> 21:11.160]  Oh, the Jordanians. I'm sorry.
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.160]  I just got out of the hospital.
[21:13.160 --> 21:19.160]  I had a chronic trauma that affected my memory in the short term.
[21:19.160 --> 21:23.160]  But now, it's much better, Souda.
[21:23.160 --> 21:25.160]  The mission, Madame Jordan.
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.160]  How could I forget?
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.160]  Come in.
[21:29.160 --> 21:37.160]  Come in.
[21:39.160 --> 21:40.160]  We can visit this apartment.
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.160]  You came for this.
[21:43.160 --> 21:45.160]  Can you hear me?
[21:47.160 --> 21:49.160]  No, I can't hear you.
[21:56.160 --> 21:58.160]  The terrace is private.
[21:58.160 --> 22:00.160]  No, it's not.
[22:07.160 --> 22:09.160]  The bedroom is empty.
[22:09.160 --> 22:20.160]  Come and see if we'd like to show you something.
[22:29.160 --> 22:31.160]  This is humidity, isn't it?
[22:31.160 --> 22:35.160]  Mr. Tronnier, the ceiling has humidity.
[22:37.160 --> 22:38.160]  So?
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.160]  It shouldn't be like that.
[22:41.160 --> 22:44.160]  There are many things in this world that shouldn't be like that, Madame Jordan.
[22:44.160 --> 22:45.160]  And yet, they're coming.
[22:45.160 --> 22:48.160]  The families of Darfur, the massacres in Syria.
[22:48.160 --> 22:50.160]  A child who's being crushed on the side of the road.
[22:51.160 --> 22:54.160]  Yes, okay, but it's not really a problem.
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.160]  Good evening, Della, the principal.
[22:58.160 --> 23:00.160]  Long in the eyes of the English teacher,
[23:00.160 --> 23:02.160]  and you'll see the angel of death.
[23:02.160 --> 23:05.160]  Breathe in your breath, and you'll discover hell.
[23:05.160 --> 23:07.160]  Look between those five who fall,
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.160]  and you'll know the city.
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.160]  Thank you.
[23:17.160 --> 23:19.160]  Why did you do that, Sophie?
[23:19.160 --> 23:22.160]  I'm sure this door will be re-painted in the shortest time.
[23:22.160 --> 23:24.160]  You can't re-paint this door.
[23:24.160 --> 23:27.160]  Your daughter engraved her little poetry with her nails.
[23:27.160 --> 23:29.160]  Then we'll have to change the door.
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.160]  You have something to say to your English teacher?
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.160]  Huh?
[23:37.160 --> 23:38.160]  Sorry.
[23:40.160 --> 23:41.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:41.160 --> 23:42.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:44.160 --> 23:45.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:45.160 --> 23:46.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:50.160 --> 23:51.160]  I'm sorry.
[23:51.160 --> 23:52.160]  What happened to you, Tondra?
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.160]  Thank you.
[24:04.160 --> 24:06.160]  Why are you so stressed out?
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.160]  And I'm not stressed out?
[24:08.160 --> 24:10.160]  It's a toilet door, sir!
[24:10.160 --> 24:12.160]  Do you want people to go to hell or what?
[24:12.160 --> 24:13.160]  Wait!
[24:15.160 --> 24:18.160]  I speak loudly because you don't listen to me.
[24:19.160 --> 24:20.160]  Yes.
[24:21.160 --> 24:22.160]  Yes, very well.
[24:22.160 --> 24:23.160]  Here, thank you, sir.
[24:28.160 --> 24:30.160]  That's it. Everything's settled.
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.160]  Huh?
[24:31.160 --> 24:33.160]  How much do you want for the door?
[24:33.160 --> 24:34.160]  Hmm.
[24:36.160 --> 24:37.160]  Is it important?
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.160]  My mum says you're wrong.
[24:39.160 --> 24:42.160]  Well, it's nice of you to talk about me.
[24:42.160 --> 24:45.160]  Your sister just went to sleep at home last night.
[24:45.160 --> 24:46.160]  Ah.
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.160]  She always takes it to her hiding place.
[24:49.160 --> 24:51.160]  Can I sleep at your place?
[24:52.160 --> 24:53.160]  Well...
[24:54.160 --> 24:55.160]  Tonight...
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.160]  You don't have to worry about me.
[24:58.160 --> 25:00.160]  And when will it be possible?
[25:00.160 --> 25:01.160]  Sophie, I...
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.160]  Since divorce?
[25:03.160 --> 25:05.160]  I've never come to your place. Not even once.
[25:06.160 --> 25:07.160]  Are you sure?
[25:07.160 --> 25:09.160]  Really? Don't tell me things like that.
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.160]  Are you sure? You're always going to a Nazi cafΘ?
[25:11.160 --> 25:12.160]  Like I was your mistress!
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.160]  No, hey, stop it!
[25:14.160 --> 25:15.160]  Huh?
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.160]  I don't have the week of Louis' death.
[25:18.160 --> 25:20.160]  You can't let it fall a bit.
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.160]  Why do you call her Louise? Is she your mother?
[25:22.160 --> 25:25.160]  The psychoanalyst's sessions have made it another day, okay?
[25:29.160 --> 25:30.160]  She's going to miss me.
[25:31.160 --> 25:32.160]  I know.
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  She's the only normal person in this family.
[25:35.160 --> 25:38.160]  No, she's not quite normal.
[25:39.160 --> 25:40.160]  I'm sure.
[25:46.160 --> 25:47.160]  But she loves me.
[25:49.160 --> 25:51.160]  Yes, you love her.
[25:56.160 --> 25:57.160]  What do you draw?
[25:58.160 --> 25:59.160]  Us.
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.160]  I'm a goldsmith.
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.160]  That's beautiful.
[26:05.160 --> 26:07.160]  So, what do you want us to talk about?
[26:07.160 --> 26:09.160]  I'll turn off the phone.
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.160]  And there's a good lemon tart that hasn't arrived yet.
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.160]  We're going to eat it all together.
[26:15.160 --> 26:16.160]  I don't answer.
[26:18.160 --> 26:19.160]  You and I,
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.160]  we're part of the goldsmith.
[26:22.160 --> 26:23.160]  I don't answer.
[26:25.160 --> 26:26.160]  You and I,
[26:26.160 --> 26:52.160]  we're part of the goldsmith.
[26:56.160 --> 26:57.160]  This is a big loss.
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.160]  I have to answer.
[26:59.160 --> 27:01.160]  Yes, I'm with my accountant.
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.160]  I remember.
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.160]  What's this duty?
[27:05.160 --> 27:06.160]  You're drunk.
[27:08.160 --> 27:09.160]  And we're not alone.
[27:11.160 --> 27:12.160]  You're alone?
[27:13.160 --> 27:14.160]  Can you get up?
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.160]  What?
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.160]  No.
[27:17.160 --> 27:18.160]  I can't move.
[27:18.160 --> 27:19.160]  Move?
[27:19.160 --> 27:20.160]  I can't move.
[27:22.160 --> 27:23.160]  No.
[27:23.160 --> 27:24.160]  No, no, no.
[27:24.160 --> 27:27.160]  No, no, I'm coming. Don't move, don't move!
[27:27.160 --> 27:40.160]  I have to go. I'll take you on your way.
[27:57.160 --> 28:04.160]  What's going on?
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.160]  There's a train passing by.
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.160]  First of all, you.
[28:12.160 --> 28:13.160]  What's that smell?
[28:13.160 --> 28:14.160]  Petrol?
[28:14.160 --> 28:15.160]  It's calva.
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.160]  It's Richard's sister who did it herself.
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.160]  What's happened to your arm?
[28:22.160 --> 28:24.160]  Nothing.
[28:24.160 --> 28:27.160]  Where's the can I gave you?
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.160]  I lost it.
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.160]  Already? Where is it?
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.160]  It's Richard at the poker.
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.160]  You played your can at the poker?
[28:38.160 --> 28:41.160]  I had the hand of the dead.
[28:41.160 --> 28:43.160]  The one of Wabbley and Cock.
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.160]  Two aces of Anne.
[28:44.160 --> 28:45.160]  A winning hand.
[28:45.160 --> 28:48.160]  You lost your can with a winning hand.
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.160]  Yes, and Robert had an umbrella then.
[28:51.160 --> 28:53.160]  I'll take you there.
[28:53.160 --> 28:55.160]  No, no, no. I'm fine here.
[28:55.160 --> 28:58.160]  It's not possible. I don't want to leave you alone like that.
[28:58.160 --> 29:01.160]  And you're not going to tell me what I have to do and not do?
[29:01.160 --> 29:03.160]  But I want to help you.
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.160]  You want to help me?
[29:04.160 --> 29:23.160]  Good morning, club.
[29:34.160 --> 29:49.160]  As the proverb says, it's easier to break than to stick.
[29:49.160 --> 29:53.160]  I'm strong when it comes to breaking.
[29:53.160 --> 29:55.160]  Sometimes to stick.
[29:55.160 --> 29:57.160]  I'm happy to have your knowledge.
[29:57.160 --> 29:59.160]  Olivier Tronnier.
[29:59.160 --> 30:00.160]  Simon Helmallet.
[30:00.160 --> 30:03.160]  You have glue.
[30:03.160 --> 30:06.160]  Yes.
[30:06.160 --> 30:09.160]  He's still late.
[30:09.160 --> 30:10.160]  Who?
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.160]  The big one.
[30:11.160 --> 30:13.160]  It's your friend, that's good.
[30:13.160 --> 30:16.160]  He's going to talk to you.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.160]  Philippe, yes.
[30:18.160 --> 30:21.160]  We were very close friends.
[30:21.160 --> 30:22.160]  We were.
[30:22.160 --> 30:25.160]  Did something happen?
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.160]  He gives you money too.
[30:28.160 --> 30:29.160]  Why do you say that?
[30:29.160 --> 30:31.160]  Just like that. I guessed.
[30:31.160 --> 30:33.160]  You can call to check that he's well on the road.
[30:33.160 --> 30:37.160]  He doesn't take my calls, he blocks me.
[30:37.160 --> 30:45.160]  He's dead.
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.160]  Ok, listen.
[30:47.160 --> 30:50.160]  If there's one thing that I'm testing more than the money,
[30:50.160 --> 30:52.160]  it's the breadwinners.
[30:52.160 --> 30:54.160]  Tell Philippe that before 10,000 euros,
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.160]  we're going to get 5,000 euros.
[30:55.160 --> 30:56.160]  If he doesn't make this money in a second,
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.160]  the amount goes to 7,000.
[30:58.160 --> 31:01.160]  He died in an accident yesterday.
[31:01.160 --> 31:02.160]  Of course.
[31:02.160 --> 31:03.160]  He could have died.
[31:03.160 --> 31:05.160]  A heart attack like everyone else.
[31:05.160 --> 31:07.160]  5,000 euros until Friday.
[31:07.160 --> 31:09.160]  Then it's 7,000.
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.160]  If I were you, I'd take notes.
[31:11.160 --> 31:13.160]  To avoid confusion.
[31:13.160 --> 31:14.160]  But...
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.160]  No, please.
[31:15.160 --> 31:16.160]  It's an affair between Philippe and me.
[31:16.160 --> 31:17.160]  Don't insist on that.
[31:17.160 --> 31:19.160]  Excuse me, Mr Helmallet.
[31:19.160 --> 31:20.160]  Shit.
[31:20.160 --> 31:22.160]  Excuse me.
[31:22.160 --> 31:24.160]  I have a question about...
[31:24.160 --> 31:27.160]  about everything else.
[31:27.160 --> 31:30.160]  You're in the car, aren't you?
[31:30.160 --> 31:32.160]  Philippe talked to me about you yesterday.
[31:32.160 --> 31:34.160]  Before or after his death?
[31:34.160 --> 31:36.160]  I inherited from an immobile,
[31:36.160 --> 31:38.160]  from General Brunet.
[31:42.160 --> 31:44.160]  27, after General Brunet?
[31:44.160 --> 31:46.160]  He talked to me, right?
[31:46.160 --> 31:47.160]  Yes.
[31:47.160 --> 31:49.160]  It's been a while since the immobile looks like that.
[31:49.160 --> 31:51.160]  When Philippe was present in this affair, he told me.
[31:51.160 --> 31:53.160]  He represented me, yes.
[31:53.160 --> 31:55.160]  Of course, I forgot.
[31:55.160 --> 31:57.160]  I wanted to sell it.
[31:57.160 --> 31:59.160]  As you can see, I'm also in the immobile,
[31:59.160 --> 32:01.160]  but I mostly take care of an isolated apartment.
[32:01.160 --> 32:03.160]  Less projects on a large scale.
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.160]  So, in relation to an animal like that...
[32:05.160 --> 32:07.160]  What is it?
[32:07.160 --> 32:10.160]  If you give it to me without a municipal tax,
[32:10.160 --> 32:12.160]  or with the order of demolition,
[32:12.160 --> 32:14.160]  and without locating it,
[32:14.160 --> 32:16.160]  I give it to you.
[32:16.160 --> 32:18.160]  Isn't it cute?
