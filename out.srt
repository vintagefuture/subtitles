1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.220
I put a yellow and a black tape on it

2
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.760
Ahhh!

3
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.760
There you go.

5
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.760
The terrace?

6
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760
It's private.

7
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.760
It's part of the apartment.

8
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.760
It's registered as a disaster.

9
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760
Okay.

10
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
What is it?

11
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
Can you hear me?

12
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
No, I can't hear anything.

13
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.760
Yes, absolutely.

14
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.760
And we're at the heart of the wedding.

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.760
In the middle of an animation district.

16
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760
This kind of apartment

17
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
is hard to find in Paris.

18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
The owners of this apartment

19
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
don't put it on the market.

20
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760
The walls are very...

21
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
dark.

22
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760
The owner is a bit like a chipot

23
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.760
when the last locator left

24
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
she asked him to repaint

25
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
two months ago.

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760
He said he needed to repaint

27
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
but not of any color.

28
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
So, to avenge

29
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760
he repainted it in black.

30
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760
But it's a bit too much.

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
Because it's in some places

32
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760
the blackness is perfect

33
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
as...

34
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760
Attention.

35
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
What is your son's name?

36
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760
Alphonse.

37
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760
Be careful because the floor is very slippery.

38
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.760
What is the concept of the columns

39
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760
in the middle of the room?

40
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
It's feng shui.

41
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
Yes, feng shui.

42
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.760
The owner wanted to create a flow of energy

43
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760
between the living room

44
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.760
and the bedroom.

45
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760
Alphonse.

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760
Alphonse!

47
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
Alphonse!

48
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
Sir, you asked me to stay calm.

49
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760
Alphonse.

50
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
I'm really angry.

51
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.760
He's adopted.

52
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760
Why do you say that?

53
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Sir, you're an immobilized agent.

54
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760
We visit an apartment.

55
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760
It's not a family therapy.

56
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.760
It's not serious at all.

57
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.760
What is that?

58
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.760
What is it?

59
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.760
And when we know what it is,

60
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.760
we'll call again.

61
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760
It's not a problem.

62
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
Madam.

63
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760
Sorry.

64
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760
I have to answer you.

65
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
It's my parents.

66
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Yes, dad.

67
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
You're my client.

68
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760
I can...

69
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.760
Huh?

70
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760
What?

71
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:22.760
What's that?

72
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.760
Okay.

73
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.760
I have to read you the whole test.

74
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760
Can you read it?

75
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760
According to the law,

76
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760
I'm supposed to read the whole test.

77
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760
Can you read the whole test?

78
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
It's not serious.

79
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760
You listened to your mother's test.

80
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760
It takes time.

81
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
Philip, I'm 50 years old.

82
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760
My mother is dead.

83
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760
I'm not hungry.

84
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.760
Take this round.

85
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.760
The food is delicious.

86
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.760
It's the Belgian chocolate.

87
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
As much as the wine is disgusting,

88
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
it doesn't taste like chocolate.

89
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760
I don't know how they do it.

90
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.760
Philip, are you going to please us?

91
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.760
It won't be that complicated.

92
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.760
My mother had nothing.

93
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.760
Nothing?

94
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.760
You don't have a car.

95
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.760
No value items.

96
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760
That's enough.

97
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.760
My mother wasn't crazy about you.

98
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.760
So we read this nothing.

99
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
We sign where you tell us.

100
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.760
And we go to the next stage.

101
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760
In fact,

102
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.760
it's not exactly like that.

103
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
Yes, what?

104
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760
Your mother owned a furniture store in Paris.

105
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760
Which one?

106
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.760
A furniture store in the 19th century.

107
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.760
Can you tell me what you find funny?

108
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760
What I find funny is that

109
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760
imagine that your wife bought a furniture store

110
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.760
and you weren't running.

111
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760
I'm not sure she bought it.

112
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760
She found it in the street?

113
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.760
Why didn't you tell us before?

114
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760
It's a professional secret, Olivier.

115
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760
I'm your best friend.

116
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.760
I know, but your mother didn't tell me anything.

117
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.760
So she found it in the street?

118
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760
Wait, please.

119
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.760
Dad, I need to understand

120
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760
what's going on.

121
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.760
What's going on?

122
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760
Your mother owned this furniture store.

123
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760
She liked it.

124
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.760
It's supposed to be good news.

125
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.760
Good news, good news.

126
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.760
And if not, your wife is crying.

127
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.760
She owns her wedding box collection.

128
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.760
Can you still use it?

129
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760
Do we exchange it?

130
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760
There are localities in this furniture store.

131
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.760
All apartments are empty.

132
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.760
Except one.

133
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760
There's a locality.

134
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.760
Her name is Liliane Petresco.

135
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.760
She pays 550 euros per month.

136
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760
No, but it must be a knowledge of your mother.

137
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.760
If I were you,

138
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.760
I'd give her her share

139
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760
and I'd sell the whole furniture store.

140
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
Olivier?

141
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760
Yes.

142
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760
Olivier,

143
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
my condolences.

144
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.760
Can you move your car, please?

145
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760
Yes, in five minutes.

146
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.760
What's that?

147
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.760
Nothing.

148
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760
It's for the clients. I just tasted it.

149
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760
Taste it?

150
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.760
Enjoy it.

151
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760
I'm tired of doing this kind of thing.

152
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.760
This thing,

153
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760
a lot of shit,

154
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.760
it's going to be different before bed.

155
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760
It's a combination of authentic scarves.

156
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760
Yes, I don't care, Philippe.

157
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760
You remind me of my mother.

158
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760
You free us.

159
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.760
We sign here.

160
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760
No, don't worry.

161
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.760
If you want, we can go together.

162
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760
Yes.

163
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.760
Come on.

164
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760
See you there at three o'clock, okay?

165
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.760
Anyway, Julia's going to throw the trash.

166
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Say goodbye.

167
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760
Come on, Julia.

168
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760
It's funny.

169
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.760
You're going to throw the trash away?

170
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Why?

171
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760
It's a women's world.

172
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.760
We don't have time to waste.

173
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760
You don't want us to stop?

174
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.760
And then I'll make you some courses?

175
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.760
I'll take away friends.

176
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760
But you don't want me to bring you home?

177
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760
I'm going to take a beer

178
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.760
and then I'll find a place to sleep.

179
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.760
Come on.

180
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.760
Wait, I have something for you.

181
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
What?

182
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.760
A cognac bottle?

183
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.760
A company animal?

184
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.760
You remember what the doctor said, right?

185
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.760
On balance.

186
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.760
It's an idiot.

187
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.760
No, listen.

188
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760
I'm going to let you fall.

189
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.760
You're going to break your neck.

190
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760
Okay.

191
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.760
I'm going to do what the idiot said.

192
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.760
Bob, I data well.

193
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.760
I'm going to dig.

194
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.760
I'm going to dig.

195
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.760
It's an idiot, isn't it Bob?

196
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.760
You can't be each other's computer.

197
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.760
It's cool.

198
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.760
No problem.

199
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.760
No problem?

200
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.760
How is that educational?

201
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.760
School double.

202
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.760
This is the number 27 of the future of General Brunet.

203
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.760
There's no number on the buildings.

204
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
The 27?

205
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160
Yes.

206
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360
Yes, that's me.

207
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.960
Okay, thank you. Good continuation.

208
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
Yes, look, I am General Brunet.

209
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360
Number 27.

210
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.160
Yes, all the way down there.

211
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.960
You have the first floor.

212
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.360
If you go up a little bit here, you have terraces.

213
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.360
And there you even have the lippards for the guy who lives in his penthouse.

214
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560
Did you find it on the plate?

215
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760
On the plate?

216
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.360
One day, I was cleaning under the building.

217
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360
And it fell on my head.

218
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.760
Okay, I immediately saw that you were a kind of distinguished guy.

219
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960
Yes.

220
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Would you give me 20 euros?

221
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360
What?

222
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560
Would you give me 20 euros for me?

223
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760
My mother has a cancer from pancreas.

224
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960
If you give me 20 euros, I could pay her a hot drink.

225
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
I don't have the money.

226
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360
Are you kidding me?

227
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.960
It's true, but it's time to start, sir.

228
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160
I'm not kidding.

229
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.160
My mother is really sick.

230
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360
So if you give me 10 euros, I could pay her a bowl of soup.

231
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560
And tell me, she's in a bad mood.

232
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760
It's the shit of your mother.

233
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.960
Hey, it's 5 euros.

234
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160
No, I don't have it.

235
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
I don't give a shit, but at least you believe me.

236
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Hey!

237
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360
Hey, stop it!

238
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560
Shut up!

239
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
Oh, fuck!

240
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960
Shit!

241
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Shit!

242
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Are you all right?

243
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.360
Well, I had a good time in New York.

244
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560
Really?

245
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
What's that?

246
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.760
That?

247
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
Yes.

248
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160
It's for the baby.

249
00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360
Ah!

250
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560
Next to the shoe store, there's an animal.

251
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.760
When I went out, I saw this fish that was swimming.

252
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960
He was looking at me.

253
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160
We don't swim, fish.

254
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360
You see what I mean?

255
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.560
It's a very rare species.

256
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
It's a very rare species.

257
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.960
It's a very rare species.

258
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.160
It's a very rare species.

259
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360
It's a very rare species.

260
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560
It's a very rare species.

261
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760
It's a very rare species.

262
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760
It's a very rare species.

263
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960
What?

264
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
Do you know the story of the fish that makes them want to?

265
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.360
The salesman of the store told me that in the original account,

266
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.560
it was exactly this species.

267
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.760
If you choose me, it's for happiness.

268
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960
But I'm your fish.

269
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Yes, yes.

270
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
Tell me just a second.

271
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560
No, but...

272
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760
Be careful, he's fragile.

273
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960
Yes, yes, yes.

274
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160
Oh!

275
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360
Oh, fuck!

276
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560
You're stupid!

277
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560
Wait, are you all right?

278
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760
I'm just kidding.

279
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960
There's always no confidence with you.

280
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
No, but...

281
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160
Don't worry, it's not your baby yet.

282
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.360
It's just a stupid fish.

283
00:10:48.360 --> 00:11:10.360
It doesn't look like a stupid fish.

284
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360
Are you all right?

285
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560
Yes.

286
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.760
You don't have to be so stressed out.

287
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.960
I'm going to sell him the fact that

288
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
it's not a place worthy of a woman of her age,

289
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360
but because she was a friend of your mother.

290
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

291
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760
You want to find a more suitable place.

292
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960
It's not suitable for you.

293
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
You saw yourself, you're red like a tomato.

294
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160
You know,

295
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.360
when I think I'm going to become a father,

296
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.560
what scares me the most is that my child runs away.

297
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
And I don't have the strength to follow him.

298
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.760
Well, for the first year, they're going to be cramped.

299
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960
So you can only be cramped behind her.

300
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.960
Listen,

301
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160
I forgot to tell you.

302
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360
I'll be back in the corner tomorrow.

303
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.560
I have an appointment with your office.

304
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760
For what?

305
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.960
I told you, I have to have some money.

306
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
I don't have money, so I can't do that at home.

307
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.360
But if I do, when he comes, what do I do?

308
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.560
Well, you'll have the chance to meet him.

309
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.560
He's an immobilized promoter,

310
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760
a superman type.

311
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.960
I already talked about your imbecile, by the way.

312
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960
He's a potential buyer.

313
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
You know I'd rather you ask me for my opinion,

314
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.360
before I propose my own good to people you owe money to.

315
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.360
How many floors are there?

316
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560
We are.

317
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.760
Come on, do your job.

318
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.960
I can do what I can.

319
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
Who the hell is he, Franτois?

320
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.360
He's old. He's probably dead.

321
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.560
You say that for such a long time?

322
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560
Yes.

323
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.560
Do you remember?

324
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.760
You've got it.

325
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.960
It's like you were in love.

326
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960
Nobody's at home.

327
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
Shit.

328
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360
Are we going to eat a piece?

329
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.560
No way. If I'm late, Julia's going to make me a scene.

330
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.760
She's jealous.

331
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.960
Charlotte was like that too. She always thought I was wrong.

332
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.960
No way.

333
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
Tronie immobilized, hello.

334
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
No, it's nothing new.

335
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.560
It's four bedrooms, the roof is locked.

336
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.760
It's perfect.

337
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960
Very good.

338
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
Olivier, there's an elevator.

339
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.360
What can I tell you, Mr Jardin?

340
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.560
Mr Jardin?

341
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.760
I think he's an expert in Paris.

342
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:43.760
No, I think he's an expert in Paris. This apartment is a mess.

343
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.760
Ah!

344
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.760
Ah!

345
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.760
Ah!

346
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.760
Are you okay? Everything's fine?

347
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.960
Yes.

348
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760
Excuse me.

349
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.960
When you arrived near the elevator, what did you see?

350
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
That is to say that Philippe didn't move.

351
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360
The fish was moving without stopping.

352
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560
He looked at me.

353
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.760
He looked at me.

354
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.960
He looked at me.

355
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
He looked at me.

356
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
He looked at me.

357
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.360
The fish looked at you.

358
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.560
It's a very special fish.

359
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.760
The Chinese say it exudes the...

360
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.960
The Chinese...

361
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.160
And when Philippe showed me the first time, I got mad at him.

362
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.360
He was ugly.

363
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.560
The fish?

364
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.760
His daughter must have been happy the other day.

365
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.960
He wanted to offer him something special.

366
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.960
Who? Philippe?

367
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
Is that the name of the fish?

368
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960
48 minutes.

369
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
You think so?

370
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.360
Yes, I said so.

371
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.560
I said, ma'am, I lost my voice.

372
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.360
Yes, I said ma'am or doctor.

373
00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.360
I may be a little doctor, but what does it change?

374
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.560
What does it matter?

375
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.760
You're not going to start again?

376
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.760
Wait, wait.

377
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.960
Listen to me.

378
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
I'm here to get rid of this fucking knife that you put in my skin.

379
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.360
I'm not going to the hospitals to find fucking shots.

380
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.360
No, no, I'm not going to kill you.

381
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.560
It's not against you.

382
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

383
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.960
But, but yes, I may be smiling.

384
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
I'm smiling because of politeness, but it's not like with your sister.

385
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.360
With your sister, I was drunk.

386
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.560
Hello?

387
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.760
Hello?

388
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.760
We're going to pick them up.

389
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.760
Don't you see the fire?

390
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.760
Thank you.

391
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960
What happened to you?

392
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.960
I saved the life of a friend.

393
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
A friend?

394
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.960
It's a friend, yes.

395
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.960
The car that was turned upside down, then it took fire.

396
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.960
The windows were completely closed.

397
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.160
They started to convulcate inside.

398
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.360
So I...

399
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.560
I knew what I was doing, I knew what I was doing, but...

400
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.760
Until life broke apart.

401
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.960
And life broke apart.

402
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.960
And I thought my arm was broken.

403
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
What did you do?

404
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.360
I did what anyone would do to my place.

405
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.560
Anyone? Like a hero?

406
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:32.560
I wish I had a friend like you.

407
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.560
Hello, you're welcome on Julia's local message.

408
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.760
You can leave me a message after the beep.

409
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.960
Good evening, Julia.

410
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.160
What's up?

411
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360
What's up?

412
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.560
What's up?

413
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.760
What's up?

414
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.960
What's up?

415
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160
What's up?

416
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.360
What's up?

417
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.560
What's up?

418
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.560
What's up?

419
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.760
What's up?

420
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.960
What's up?

421
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.160
I'm in a hurry.

422
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.360
I don't want to talk to Julia anymore.

423
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.560
I'm in a hurry.

424
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.760
I'm in a hurry.

425
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.960
I'm in a hurry.

426
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
I'm in a hurry.

427
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:49.160
I can't sleep this night. I hug you so hard. Goodbye.

428
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.160
That's why.

429
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
We're the Jordanians.

430
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
Well, I'm a troddy.

431
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160
What's going on?

432
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.160
We're not used to having visits with an immobilized agent in Chaucette.

433
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.160
Oh, the Jordanians. I'm sorry.

434
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160
I just got out of the hospital.

435
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.160
I had a chronic trauma that affected my memory in the short term.

436
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.160
But now, it's much better, Souda.

437
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.160
The mission, Madame Jordan.

438
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.160
How could I forget?

439
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.160
Come in.

440
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:40.160
Come in.

441
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160
We can visit this apartment.

442
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.160
You came for this.

443
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
Can you hear me?

444
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.160
No, I can't hear you.

445
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.160
The terrace is private.

446
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160
No, it's not.

447
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160
The bedroom is empty.

448
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:23.160
Come and see if we'd like to show you something.

449
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
This is humidity, isn't it?

450
00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.160
Mr. Tronnier, the ceiling has humidity.

451
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160
So?

452
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
It shouldn't be like that.

453
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.160
There are many things in this world that shouldn't be like that, Madame Jordan.

454
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160
And yet, they're coming.

455
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
The families of Darfur, the massacres in Syria.

456
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
A child who's being crushed on the side of the road.

457
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.160
Yes, okay, but it's not really a problem.

458
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160
Good evening, Della, the principal.

459
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.160
Long in the eyes of the English teacher,

460
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.160
and you'll see the angel of death.

461
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.160
Breathe in your breath, and you'll discover hell.

462
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160
Look between those five who fall,

463
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
and you'll know the city.

464
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
Thank you.

465
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160
Why did you do that, Sophie?

466
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.160
I'm sure this door will be re-painted in the shortest time.

467
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
You can't re-paint this door.

468
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.160
Your daughter engraved her little poetry with her nails.

469
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.160
Then we'll have to change the door.

470
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.160
You have something to say to your English teacher?

471
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160
Huh?

472
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160
Sorry.

473
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.160
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
I'm sorry.

479
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
I'm sorry.

480
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
I'm sorry.

481
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.160
What happened to you, Tondra?

482
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160
Thank you.

483
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.160
Why are you so stressed out?

484
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
And I'm not stressed out?

485
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.160
It's a toilet door, sir!

486
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160
Do you want people to go to hell or what?

487
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.160
Wait!

488
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160
I speak loudly because you don't listen to me.

489
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
Yes.

490
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160
Yes, very well.

491
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160
Here, thank you, sir.

492
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
That's it. Everything's settled.

493
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
Huh?

494
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.160
How much do you want for the door?

495
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160
Hmm.

496
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160
Is it important?

497
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.160
My mum says you're wrong.

498
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.160
Well, it's nice of you to talk about me.

499
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
Your sister just went to sleep at home last night.

500
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160
Ah.

501
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160
She always takes it to her hiding place.

502
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.160
Can I sleep at your place?

503
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.160
Well...

504
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160
Tonight...

505
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.160
You don't have to worry about me.

506
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160
And when will it be possible?

507
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160
Sophie, I...

508
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160
Since divorce?

509
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.160
I've never come to your place. Not even once.

510
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160
Are you sure?

511
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.160
Really? Don't tell me things like that.

512
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160
Are you sure? You're always going to a Nazi cafΘ?

513
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160
Like I was your mistress!

514
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.160
No, hey, stop it!

515
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160
Huh?

516
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.160
I don't have the week of Louis' death.

517
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.160
You can't let it fall a bit.

518
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.160
Why do you call her Louise? Is she your mother?

519
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.160
The psychoanalyst's sessions have made it another day, okay?

520
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160
She's going to miss me.

521
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160
I know.

522
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.160
She's the only normal person in this family.

523
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.160
No, she's not quite normal.

524
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.160
I'm sure.

525
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.160
But she loves me.

526
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.160
Yes, you love her.

527
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
What do you draw?

528
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160
Us.

529
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160
I'm a goldsmith.

530
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160
That's beautiful.

531
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.160
So, what do you want us to talk about?

532
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.160
I'll turn off the phone.

533
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.160
And there's a good lemon tart that hasn't arrived yet.

534
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.160
We're going to eat it all together.

535
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160
I don't answer.

536
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160
You and I,

537
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160
we're part of the goldsmith.

538
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160
I don't answer.

539
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160
You and I,

540
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:55.160
we're part of the goldsmith.

541
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160
This is a big loss.

542
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
I have to answer.

543
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.160
Yes, I'm with my accountant.

544
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
I remember.

545
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160
What's this duty?

546
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160
You're drunk.

547
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.160
And we're not alone.

548
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160
You're alone?

549
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160
Can you get up?

550
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160
What?

551
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160
No.

552
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.160
I can't move.

553
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160
Move?

554
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160
I can't move.

555
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160
No.

556
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160
No, no, no.

557
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.160
No, no, I'm coming. Don't move, don't move!

558
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:43.160
I have to go. I'll take you on your way.

559
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:07.160
What's going on?

560
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.160
There's a train passing by.

561
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.160
First of all, you.

562
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160
What's that smell?

563
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160
Petrol?

564
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160
It's calva.

565
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.160
It's Richard's sister who did it herself.

566
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.160
What's happened to your arm?

567
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.160
Nothing.

568
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.160
Where's the can I gave you?

569
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.160
I lost it.

570
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.160
Already? Where is it?

571
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.160
It's Richard at the poker.

572
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.160
You played your can at the poker?

573
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.160
I had the hand of the dead.

574
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.160
The one of Wabbley and Cock.

575
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160
Two aces of Anne.

576
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160
A winning hand.

577
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.160
You lost your can with a winning hand.

578
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.160
Yes, and Robert had an umbrella then.

579
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.160
I'll take you there.

580
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.160
No, no, no. I'm fine here.

581
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.160
It's not possible. I don't want to leave you alone like that.

582
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.160
And you're not going to tell me what I have to do and not do?

583
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.160
But I want to help you.

584
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160
You want to help me?

585
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:26.160
Good morning, club.

586
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:52.160
As the proverb says, it's easier to break than to stick.

587
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.160
I'm strong when it comes to breaking.

588
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
Sometimes to stick.

589
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160
I'm happy to have your knowledge.

590
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.160
Olivier Tronnier.

591
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160
Simon Helmallet.

592
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.160
You have glue.

593
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.160
Yes.

594
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.160
He's still late.

595
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160
Who?

596
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160
The big one.

597
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.160
It's your friend, that's good.

598
00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.160
He's going to talk to you.

599
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.160
Philippe, yes.

600
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.160
We were very close friends.

601
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160
We were.

602
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.160
Did something happen?

603
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.160
He gives you money too.

604
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.160
Why do you say that?

605
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.160
Just like that. I guessed.

606
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.160
You can call to check that he's well on the road.

607
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.160
He doesn't take my calls, he blocks me.

608
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:48.160
He's dead.

609
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160
Ok, listen.

610
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.160
If there's one thing that I'm testing more than the money,

611
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.160
it's the breadwinners.

612
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.160
Tell Philippe that before 10,000 euros,

613
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160
we're going to get 5,000 euros.

614
00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160
If he doesn't make this money in a second,

615
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.160
the amount goes to 7,000.

616
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.160
He died in an accident yesterday.

617
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.160
Of course.

618
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160
He could have died.

619
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160
A heart attack like everyone else.

620
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.160
5,000 euros until Friday.

621
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
Then it's 7,000.

622
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.160
If I were you, I'd take notes.

623
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160
To avoid confusion.

624
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160
But...

625
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160
No, please.

626
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160
It's an affair between Philippe and me.

627
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160
Don't insist on that.

628
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.160
Excuse me, Mr Helmallet.

629
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160
Shit.

630
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160
Excuse me.

631
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160
I have a question about...

632
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160
about everything else.

633
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.160
You're in the car, aren't you?

634
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.160
Philippe talked to me about you yesterday.

635
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.160
Before or after his death?

636
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.160
I inherited from an immobile,

637
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.160
from General Brunet.

638
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.160
27, after General Brunet?

639
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.160
He talked to me, right?

640
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160
Yes.

641
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.160
It's been a while since the immobile looks like that.

642
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.160
When Philippe was present in this affair, he told me.

643
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.160
He represented me, yes.

644
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.160
Of course, I forgot.

645
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.160
I wanted to sell it.

646
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.160
As you can see, I'm also in the immobile,

647
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160
but I mostly take care of an isolated apartment.

648
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.160
Less projects on a large scale.

649
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.160
So, in relation to an animal like that...

650
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.160
What is it?

651
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.160
If you give it to me without a municipal tax,

652
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.160
or with the order of demolition,

653
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.160
and without locating it,

654
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160
I give it to you.

655
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.160
Isn't it cute?
